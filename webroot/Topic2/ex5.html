    <h3 id="hobbies">My Hobbies</h3>
      <p>
        I'm quite energetic and sports are a passion of mine, I've been training and competing in Taekwondo since 2015.
        I also enjoy learning to play instruments. My first instrument was the piano, and I also experimented with bamboo flutes, however I eventually started self teaching myself guitar which has become my favourite to play.
        As a creative individual, I also enjoy working on DIY projects as well as drawing digital art.
        Some of my leisure time also goes towards video games and digital comic books.
